# Changelog

## Alpha

### v1.0.0

#### Core

- **Initial Release:** Introduction of iDar-Pacman, the definitive package manager for ComputerCraft: Tweaked.
- **Full CLI Implementation:** Added all primary operations familiar to Arch Linux users, including installation (`-S`), database synchronization (`-Syy`), full system upgrade (`-Syu`), package search (`-Ss`), removal (`-R`), and query of installed packages (`-Q`).
- **True Dependency Resolution:** Implemented logic to recursively detect, resolve, and queue all necessary dependencies before installation begins.
- **Core Package Registry:** Introduced a local database (`/iDar/var/registry.lua`) to track package metadata, installed versions, and remote repository details.
- **GitHub as CDN:** Package URLs are dynamically generated to fetch manifests and files directly from GitHub tags, ensuring version stability.

#### Security & Stability

- **Sandboxed Manifest Execution:** Package metadata (manifests) are loaded and executed in a restricted environment (`sandbox = {}`) to prevent malicious code from running during dependency checks.
- **Manifest Timeout Hook:** Implemented a watchdog timer using `debug.sethook` to prevent package manifests from causing infinite loops or excessive resource usage.
- **Robust HTTP Fetching:** Added comprehensive checks for server responses (HTTP 200) and connection errors during downloads.

#### User Experience

- **Arch Linux Aesthetics:** Pixel-perfect TTY visual style, including operation tags (`::`), command headers, and the iconic installation prompt `[Y/n]`.
- **Custom Progress Bars:** Implemented a real-time progress rendering utility that calculates download speed (KB/s), percentage, and visually updates the terminal line for each file being downloaded.
- **Simulated Network Speed:** Added a small, randomized delay (`os.sleep`) during chunk downloads to simulate realistic network conditions and provide a better visual experience for the progress bar.

### v1.0.1

#### Core

**Critical Dependency Fix**: Internal package.path injection has been implemented within pacman.lua to ensure the main program and all its internal modules resolve correctly.

**Sandboxing Solution**: This injection fixes the issue in environments where package.path is reset by CC: Tweaked's sandboxing, eliminating the 'module not found' error.

#### Documentation & Standards

**Library Usage Guide**: A new section called "Using iDar Libraries in Your Programs" has been added to the SATD Specification Wiki.

**Environment Clarification**: The new guide warns developers about CC: Tweaked's limitation of resetting package.path, recommending the use of absolute paths or modifying the path only in the program's main file.

#### Installer Refinement

**Ineffective Logic Removal**: The ineffective logic attempting to persistently modify package.path through startup.lua has been removed from installer.lua. (Ensuring the base installer remains clean and only configures the alias).

### v2.0.0

#### Core System & Architecture

- **Atomic Transactions (FakeRoot):** Implemented a fully transactional installation architecture. Packages are first staged in a temporary environment (`/iDar/tmp/<session_id>/root`). Changes are only committed to the real filesystem once all downloads, validations, and hooks succeed. Automatic rollback prevents corrupt or partial installations.
- **State Management (Explicit vs Implicit):** The internal registry (`registry.lua`) now intelligently tracks whether a package was installed explicitly by the user or implicitly as a dependency. This is crucial for the new cleanup and orphan detection logic.

#### New CLI Operations

- **Cascade Removal (`-Rns`):** Added a new flag for deep uninstallation. This allows removing a package and recursively its dependencies (provided they are not required by other installed packages), keeping the system clean of unused libraries.
- **Orphan Query (`-Qtdq`):** Added the ability to audit the system for "orphan" packages—those installed as dependencies that are no longer needed—allowing users to easily identify bloatware.

#### Security & Stability

- **Secure Post-Install Hooks:** The hook system has been integrated with the `FakeRoot` environment. Post-installation scripts defined in manifests now run within the temporary sandbox, ensuring any configuration or file generation occurs safely before touching the real system.
- **Uninstall Protection:** Added a security interaction layer to the removal process (`-R`), requesting explicit `[Y/n]` confirmation before deleting files from disk.

### v2.0.1

**"The 'It Actually Works Now' Update"**

This patch addresses critical bugs found in the v2.0.0 release related to repository sourcing and package discovery.

#### Fixes

- **Critical Installer Fix:** Fixed a malformed syntax in the generation of `/iDar/etc/sources.lua`. The installer now correctly generates the source list as an array of tables. Previously, it created a single table, causing `pacman` to fail to detect any active repositories during updates.
- **Search Functionality (`-Ss`):** Fixed the search command only querying locally installed packages. It now correctly aggregates data from synchronized remote databases (`sync_dbs`), allowing users to discover and install new packages from the repository.
- **Manifest Parsing:** Refactored `manifest.lua` with a new `flatten_paths` algorithm. This improves the reliability of file path resolution when installing packages with complex directory structures.
- **URL Standardization:** Updated internal installer URLs to strictly follow the GitHub `refs/heads/` format for improved stability.

#### Technical Details

- Added `registry.get_all_packages_sync()` to the Registry API to expose remote package data explicitly.
- Updated `core.search()` to utilize the new synchronous DB accessor.
- Replaced `flatten_file_structure` with `flatten_paths` in the Manifest helper to support mixed key-value and array-based file definitions.

### v2.1.0

**"The System Integration Update"**

This release deeply integrates iDar-Pacman with the iDar Shell ecosystem by automating how executables and system commands are handled during installation.

#### Core System & Architecture

- **SATDv2.5 Support (`bin` Table):** Packages can now declare executable entry points via the optional `bin` table within their `manifest.lua`.
- **Automated Executable Linking:** The installer simulates Arch Linux's `/usr/bin/` behavior. It now automatically generates `.ptr` files (symlinks) inside `/iDar/bin/` that point directly to the newly installed package scripts, making them immediately available as commands in the iDar Shell.
- **Registry Persistence Update:** The local registry (`/iDar/var/local.lua`) has been upgraded to track and persist the `bin` mappings of installed packages locally, eliminating the need to re-download manifests during uninstallation.

#### Cleanup & Maintenance

- **Smart Dead-link Purge:** The removal process (`pacman -R` and `-Rns`) has been overhauled to read the local registry and automatically delete the associated `.ptr` files from `/iDar/bin/`. This guarantees a completely clean filesystem with no orphaned or dead commands left behind.
